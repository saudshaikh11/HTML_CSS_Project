        Molly had been staring out of her windown for about an hour. On her desk, lying between the copies of
        <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared 
        in, was a thumped copy <cite>of On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, 
        and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt> she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/141597-i-have-always-been-of-opinion-that-hard-work-is">
        Work is the refuge of the people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her 
        pioneering work, <del>inspiring</del> <ins>unravelling</ins> the secret of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
        to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had somethigng better to do.
