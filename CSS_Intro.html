    <p>
        Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their olor and form. Many are trained to grow upward
        A well designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance.
        Potagers can disguise their funtion of providing for a home in a wide area of forms - from the carefree 
        style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.
